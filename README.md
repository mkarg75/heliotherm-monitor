# heliotherm-monitor
A python based tool to monitor a heliotherm heatpump and generate rrd graphs 

The tool currently provides a list of known commands which get sent to the HP. The returning data is parsed and written into a rrd database file.

Out of the RRD database we can ultimately generate the desired graphs. 
I will work on a more automated installation and RRD creation.

Please let me know if you have more information about possible data sources or any requests for stuff I should add.
